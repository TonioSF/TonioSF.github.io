        <p>My name is Tonio Wu, my goal career is to be in the Navy. I plan to work myself to meet the requirements to be able to get thruogh the Navy bootcamp. I am a person who loves the sea. I am dedicated when it comes to what I really want to work for. I want to get into the military because I believe that it would make my life journey more interesting and I will have challenges that I am willing to face.</p>
        <p>Since when I was very young I was always the artist in the house. My parents would be sending to art school to learn to draw and paint. Eventually, due to school and many things, I was forced to stop doing art. I could only do art when I am in an art class in my school. After about seven years, when I was twelve, I started to pick up from what I had left off. I started improving a lot in art. I could say now that I am a talented illustrator. I was never really a musician. My parents sent me to school for piano lessons since I was only a few years old, I never did learn anything much. As years passed, I was never able to play any instrument. Only the recent years, around year 2015, I learned to read musical sheets for percussions. I was in the percussion for the school band since then. I loved playing drums, I could read the music sheets easier. I later on learned to play the drum set during the summer of 2018, while I was spending time with my family in Thailand.</p>
        <p>I have been training my body constantly to increase my stamina. I need to be able to pass the physical requirements in order to be able to enlist in the Navy. I am a type of person that would be working well when in the field. I love working outdoors and getting my hands on things. I also like doing type of work that would involve myself getting into an action. I joined the California Cadet Corps in Palm Deser High School. It was the best choice that I had made, I achived a lot and worked hard in the class. I went up in ranks and continued to try to achieve more as I go on in the year. I tried to become a good leader to my fellow new cadets that just came in the new year. I planned to get this mentality to a higher level to be able to work on into the Navy. I am dedicated when it comes to any types of work that requires sacrifice of somethng. When I am on duty, I had to sacrifice my own personal time for the corps. I am always making sure to do my best on the duty, following the orders of my superiors and making sure that my cadets also try their best to get their jobs done.</p>
        <p>Many things in life is rough, when people are surrounded by unpleasant things, they tend to give up. I have been facing many types of situation. Either it is good or a bad experience, I was made sure to learn and cooperate with whatever that I had gotten into with and worked with it. I take things seriously and I do not tend to back away that easily. I would try my best in whatever jobs that I get and will make sute to take pride in it as well.</p>
