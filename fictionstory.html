INCOMING ENEMY SPOTTED, you heard the yelling of one of his fellow patrol guard. He looked up towards the top of the wall and the first thing he was his fellow soldier's head blown to bits by multiple shots from the machine gun. You knew what to do, he and the other soldiers headed towards the large metal gate and tried to block it from opening, even though he knew that the enemy would be smart enough to climb the wall. Multiple traps were set on the wall through. We can handle here! Go and do what you have to do!!, Silver heard his best friend, Sterlyn Schmidt."
