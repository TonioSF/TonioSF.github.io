    <p>“Aither? What are you doing here at this hour?”</p>
    <p>The last thing that Aither would want to do is to take the life of the one who is a part of him. He looked down at the bump on his wife’s belly, all that Isabela could see in those emerald orbs was nothing but sorrow. She did not understand at all of what was going on in Aither’s mind. Only that look on his face was left for her as a mystery.</p>
    <p>“I need to work a little more. I will meet you in the chamber when I am done,” Aither turned away from her. He looked down to a large book in his hands, seeming to become a little calmer as he read, Isabela was not pleased with that attention that Aither gave to his studies. He would always say that he was seeking for the sake of his empire. King Aither of the Ocean Realm, the 563rd ruler, the wise king who was loved for his knowledge and how he would always find a way to help his people in many ways. Isabela let out a sigh before leaving her beloved husband to continue his studies. He was alone in a small library with only a single candle as a light source. There were no windows, making it as dark as a basement. All of the books on the shelves were so old that they might crumble if treated without care. Many books on the ground as well. At the center of the room, a working desk covered with scrolls and papers. Aither put all of his effort on his researches for decades. Only after a little while more of reading, the wrinkles appeared again on his temple and the bridge of his nose. He wished he had realised sooner how close he was…</p>
    <p>Time only passed quicker; fear only grew stronger. He knew it was too late, that the time is getting close. Somehow, time passed by so quickly that he could not track, until one day when time suddenly stopped.</p>
    <p>“It’s a boy, my lord!” Aither could only smile slightly as the maester handed a tiny little boy wrapped in white cloth to him. He looked down to the infant, a part of him. It had been a long day. Isabela already fell asleep after she had seen her son that she just pushed from her womb. Aither slowly walked around the throne room. Each step he took on the marble floor echoed the large room. It was peaceful when he was by himself. He looked down at the infant in his arms. A new feeling came into him as he stared at that little face.</p>
    <p>“My son..” That feeling became stronger as he said those words for the first time. It hurts him. It hurts more when he knew of the future.</p>
    <p>“Diego, I hope that you will understand me one day,” he whispered to his son in a sorrowful tone.</p>
    <p>Only two years after prince Diego was born, a deadly disease has took Isabela away in a blink of an eye. Only two months and she laid cold on her deathbed. Aither had nothing but more sorrow in his heart. He mourned as he watched his only son. Diego was only a child who knew nothing of this cruel world. He would someday forget what he had lost that day.</p>
    <p>“It seems like lord Diego is now able to walk without help, your majesty,” Lux Gavinne, Lord Commander of the Royal Army and childhood friend of Aither, watched as three year old Diego climbed up the steps towards the throne where his father was watching from. The throne room was quite peaceful, the only noise in the room was the laughter of a toddler.</p>
    <p>“Aye, indeed, and congrats on your new born son, old friend. I hope that our sons shall be close like we are,” Aither replied, turning his gaze to the knight. Lux only bowed gracefully in return.</p>
    <p>“I am sure that they will, your majesty.” he continued to watch Diego who already reached his father’s leg. Aither picked him up and placed him on his lap, he turned towards Lux.</p>
    <p>“What shall you name him?” he asked.</p>
