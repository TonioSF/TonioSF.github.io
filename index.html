    <p>“Aither? What are you doing here at this hour?”</p>
    <p>The last thing that Aither would want to do is to take the life of the one who is a part of him. He looked down at the bump on his wife’s belly, all that Isabela could see in those emerald orbs was nothing but sorrow. She did not understand at all of what was going on in Aither’s mind. Only that look on his face was left for her as a mystery.</p>
