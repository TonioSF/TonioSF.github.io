<h1>Arduino Project</h1>

<p>For this project, my partner and I had made a traffic light that is activated by a button. The circuit works by bringing the main power through a button and go through a the chain of resistors and LED, making the LEDs light up one by one from green to yellow then to red and then it would come back to yellow and then green. We use the code to make each of them light up one by one and for a certain amount of time as well. Then after the final light goes out, there would be a certain period of time to wait before the circuit would work again. The were difficulties with the code and the circuit, mostly with some broken wires and button, but we manage to overcome, finding a working materials. We also had problems with codes not working properly, we eventually spotted our errors and fixed them to have a working circuit.</p>

<p>As you can see in the video, the light goes up to red then back down to green. When we press the button the second time, it does not work because there is a timer before it could work again.</p>
